# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Engineering Manager with a passion for building distributed systems. I specialize in OpenTelemetry and specifically Distributed Tracing.

## Personal Interests
Outside of tech, I'm a hobby cook and have attended culinary school. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and meal prepping for the week.
