# Hi there, I'm Motti ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Engineering Manager with a passion for building and enhancing distributed systems. I specialize in OpenTelemetry and specifically Distributed Tracing.

## Personal Interests
Outside of tech, I'm a hobby cook and have attended culinary school. I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and meal prepping for the week.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me for collaborations or discussions on distributed systems, tracing technologies, or even cooking!
